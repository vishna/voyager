## 3.0.0-nullsafety

### BREAKING CHANGE

- migration to null-safety
- all Voyager classes are now prefixed with `Voyager`. This is due to introduction of Router in Navigator 2.0 API

## 2.1.2

- pass settings instance in routed pages - thx [@i5o](https://github.com/i5o)

## 2.1.1

Hide Voyager's Router from generated code to avoid class name class:

```
import 'package:voyager/voyager.dart' hide Router;
import 'package:voyager/voyager.dart' as voyager;

final voyager.Router router;
```

## 2.1.0

- add a class obfuscation workaround to support Web in `release` mode

## 2.0.0+1

- fix extra unused import in generated code

## 2.0.0

- use provider 4.x.x
- use extensions, e.g. context.voyager / context.voyagerArgument
- use extensions in generated code/drop VoyagerProvider/no need for voyager factory

## 1.2.0+1

- hotfix - provider4 will come in 2.0.0

## 1.2.0

- use provider 4.x.x

## 1.1.6

- remove deprecated `test_api` package import from generated test files
- use package imports everywhere, [related issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/40421#issuecomment-564330783)

## 1.1.5

- allow passing `VoyagerArgument` to stateful widgets in tests

## 1.1.4

- add slack channel badge
- allow adding onDispose callback to `Voyager` instance after lockdown.

## 1.1.3

- remove unused imports

## 1.1.2

- expose `VoyagerArgument` (if available) in `RouteContext`

## 1.1.1

- fix deadlock in code generator

## 1.1.0

- jar codegen downloader now works using `dart:io` only
- improved messaging in case of missing JDK
- `VoyagerListView` is now part of [voyager_list](https://pub.dev/packages/voyager_list) package **BREAKING CHANGE**

## 1.0.7

- Ability to combine WidgetPluginBuilders together using `addBuilder`
- more resilient `dartfmt` resolution
- use `curl` instead of `wget` for codgen jar download

## 1.0.6

- fix issue where `voyager:codgen` would not work even though `dartfmt` was present

## 1.0.5

Code generator improvements:

- `--set-exit-if-changed` will set exit to 1 if there was change in generated code
- You can keep schema in a separate file using `sourceSchema` field, check out [voyager_bloc/example](https://github.com/vishna/voyager_bloc/blob/master/example/voyager-codegen.yaml)
- You can scope paths to packages by using `package: name` in `voyager-codegen.yaml` and under respective paths in your navigation schema

## 1.0.4

- make duplicate items (that is having the same `id`) work properly with `VoyagerList`

## 1.0.3

- `VoyagerList` can now take arguments which `ListView.custom` normally takes

## 1.0.2

- Drop `VoyagerPaths` generated class

### BREAKING CHANGE

Generated paths/types are no longer wrapped in a class, so:

```dart
VoyagerPaths.pathHome
```

now simply becomes:

```dart
pathHome
```

If you want to go back to old notation you can add`as VoyagerPaths` to the import statement, e.g.:

```dart
import 'package:example/gen/voyager_gen.dart' as VoyagerPaths;
```

# 1.0.1

- add missing `import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';` to generated file

# 1.0.0

- Full library code test coverage
- YAML config validation
- Generated `VoyagerData` with strong typed `Voyager` fields.
- Option to generate PluginStubs based on config validation schema

Add your validation in `voyager-codegen.yaml`, for instance to cover `IconPlugin` you can now do this:

```yaml
- name: Voyager
  source: lib/main.dart
  target: lib/gen/voyager_gen.dart
  schema:
    icon:
      pluginStub: true # add if you want a pregenerated plugin stub
      output: Icon # associated Dart class
      import: "package:flutter/widgets.dart" # Dart import for the class, if necessary
      input: # write schema for your the icon node (JSON Schema draft-07 layout)
        type: string
        pattern: "^[a-fA-F0-9]{4}$"
```

Now whenever you run `voyager:codegen` you'll get an extra message stating all is fine:

```
âœ… Schema validated properly
```

or an error specific to your router configuration map, e.g.:

```
ðŸš¨ /fab@icon: #/icon: string [e88fd] does not match pattern ^[a-fA-F0-9]{4}$
```

Furthermore you gain **strong typed** reference to the plugin output:

```dart
final voyager = VoyagerProvider.of(context);
assert(voyager.icon is Icon);
```

__NOTE__: You must tell `Router` to use generated `VoyagerFactory`, so that it starts providing extended Voyager instances instead of vanilla ones:

```dart
loadRouter(paths(), plugins(), voyagerFactory: voyagerDataFactory)
```

Finally, `pluginStub: true` gets you an abstract plugin class, so that you can avoid typing `voyager["node_name"]` manually. Just focus on parsing the node's config input into an expected output:

```dart
class IconPlugin extends IconPluginStub {
  @override
  Icon buildObject(RouterContext context, dynamic config) {
    /// write your code here
  }
}
```


### BREAKING CHANGES

- `RouterNG` becomes `Router`
- old `VoyagerFactory` becomes `ProgrammaticVoyagerFactory`
- new `VoyagerFactory` is used to instantiate generated `VoyagerData`

## 0.9.2

- `WidgetWrapper` no longer runs in tester.runAsync scope by default

## 0.9.1

- `WidgetWrapper` for generated tests now has extra 2 parameters, `router` and `scenarios`. This should facilitate creation of the wrapping widget.

## 0.9.0

- support adding config for paths programatically ðŸŽ‰

```dart
router.registerConfig('/home', (context, Voyager voyager) {
  voyager.type = "home";
  voyager[WidgetPlugin.KEY] =
      (BuildContext buildContext) => MockHomeWidget();
  voyager["title"] = "This is Home";
})
```

You can also supply a custom inherited Voyager instance...

```dart
final VoyagerFactory<CustomVoyager> customVoyagerFactory =
  (abstractContext, context) => CustomVoyager(
    abstractContext.url(), abstractContext.getExtras().parent);

router.registerConfig<CustomVoyager>('/other/:title', (context, voyager) {
  final title = context.params["title"];
  voyager.type = "other";
  voyager.widget = (BuildContext buildContext) => MockOtherWidget();
  voyager.title = "This is a $title";
}, customVoyagerFactory);
```

> If you aim for flexibility you should stick to YAML config and avoid this method. You can mix programmatic and YAML paths together. Code generator doesn't pick up programmatic paths. You have been warned. Use wisely.

- support supplying VoyagerArgument in automated tests

```dart
VoyagerTestObjectItemScenario.write("Talk", (WidgetTester tester) async {
        expect(find.text("Mountain View"), findsOneWidget);
      }, argument: const Talk("Mountain View", "Google I/O 2020", "19 May"))
```

- added static code analysis to the project
- over 90% code coverage

## 0.8.0

### SOME BREAKING CHANGES

- dropped `TypePlugin` since it was redundant, but since `type` has a special place in Voyager, it is exposed as getter and also is validated at runtime, so it must be a String if anything
- you can now pass custom AssetBundle to `loadPathsFromAssets` method
- massive work on improving test coverage of the library - gone from 57% to above 80%
- `WidgetPluginBuilder`, better API for adding widget mappings, allows you to skip manual Widget class name typing in the dart code.

```dart
final plugins = [
  [
    WidgetPluginBuilder() /// provide widget builders for expressions used in YAML
      .add<HomeWidget>((context) => HomeWidget())
      .add<OtherWidget>((context) => OtherWidget())
      .build(),
    TitlePlugin() /// custom plugin
  ]
];
```

You can still use the old syntax, but the above one brings more type safety to your code.

## 0.7.3

- expose `VoyagerParent` in build context when using a stateless widget

## 0.7.2

- `VoyagerListView`, a widget that allows mapping a list of items onto respective list of paths and then displaying them

## 0.7.1

- add optional `Key` constructor parameter to `VoyagerWidget` and `VoyagerStatelessWidget`

## 0.7.0

- ...and we're back to stateful widget by default - while you should use StatelessWidget whenever possible, navigation is causing widget recreation which means recreation of Voyager instance - and that's something we don't want to do.
- `generator` now supports CupertinoPageRoute that can be specified via additional parameter

```dart
generator(routeType: RouterNG.cupertinoRoute)
```

- `VoyagerArgument` is available via Provider whenever you navigate with an argument
- ability to dispose resources created with WidgetPlugins via onDispose callback:

```dart
output.onDispose(() {
  print("disposing resources");
});
```

## 0.6.1

- display information in case `dartfmt` is missing from your path and you're using code generation tool.

## 0.6.0

### BREAKING CHANGES

- `VoyagerWidget` becomes stateless by default. If you want to have stateful behavior, please use `VoyagerStatefulWidget`
- Dropped `Voyager.fromPath` method, it was redundant and confusing. Use constructor directly instead.
- It is now recommended to wrap your app with `Provider<RouterNG>`. By doing this you can ommit passing the router parameter to every `VoyagerWidget` and thus making widget tree more compact since `VoyagerWidget` don't have to provide router instance themselves.

```
Provider<RouterNG>.value(
  value: router,
  child: MaterialApp(
    home: VoyagerWidget(path: initalPath),
    onGenerateRoute: router.generator()
  )
)
```

- `VoyagerWidget` has now extra cache parameter, meaning it will use RouterNG's caching internally to resolve `Voyager` instance faster. Depending on your use case you might want to use this or not. Such `Voyager` instance has no parent.

_The decision to change `VoyagerWidget` to stateless widget and removal of `fromPath` method was an inspiration after reading the following articles_:
- [Splitting Widgets To Methods is A Performance Antipattern](https://medium.com/flutter-community/splitting-widgets-to-methods-is-a-performance-antipattern-16aa3fb4026c) - Iiro Krankka
- [Flutter: Reducing widgets boilerplate](https://medium.com/@remirousselet/flutter-reducing-widgets-boilerplate-3e635f10685e) - Remi Rousselet

_It's a MUST READ for any Flutter developer._

## 0.5.2

- update to patched code generator version

## 0.5.1

- decrease occurences of voyager instance creation

## 0.5.0

> You will be automated, resistance is futile.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- automated widget tests (EXPERIMENTAL)
- removal of deprecated `VoyagerProvider`, see version `0.2.0` for migration steps (VoyagerProvider will return in a changed form...)
- removal of `TypePlugin` - it's redundant, omit it in plugins list but still use `type` in your specs for code generation goodness
- `RedirectPlugin`, allows mapping virtual paths to existing ones
- `ScreenPlugin` is now called `WidgetPlugin`, you also need to change `screen` to `widget` in your yaml/json specs

## 0.4.2

- use `dartfmt` to make sure generated code is formatted corectly

## 0.4.1

- package health

## 0.4.0

- [code generation](https://github.com/vishna/voyager#code-generation) for paths, simply run `flutter packages pub run voyager:codegen` at the top of your flutter project and behold!

## 0.3.0

- drop angel_route dependency in favor of [abstract_router.dart](https://github.com/vishna/voyager/blob/master/lib/src/abstract_router.dart)

## 0.2.3

- json support

## 0.2.2

- formatting

## 0.2.1

- fixes around how VoyagerWidget reacts to hot reload
- improve sample app
- add a sample app gif to README

# #0.2.0

**API DEPRECATION**

- `VoyagerProvider` is being phased out. Internally Voyager will depend on [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) more popular within the community.

Migration:
- change `VoyagerProvider.of(context)` to `Provider.of<Voyager>(context)`
- change `VoyagerProvider.routerOf(context)` to `Provider.of<RouterNG>(context)`

## 0.1.1
- Package health fixes

## 0.1.0
- Initial release
